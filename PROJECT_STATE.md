# PROJECT_STATE — UmamiT

> Handover between sessions: **only the current state**. Update it at the end
> of every session or phase. Finished releases, past plans and the session
> log are in [`docs/history.md`](docs/history.md); read that only when you
> need it (D-101).

**Last updated:** 2026-11-10. **[`v0.5.1`](https://github.com/katznmeik/UmamiT/releases/tag/v0.5.1) is released** (from `main` `73a97fc5`; D-110, D-111; the PO's feedback on v0.5.0: one list on Start, *Knapp ab* shows its value, *Fertig* in reach in the filter sheet, the display sans Alegreya Sans, Start holds still while *Nochmal brühen* opens the timer). Details in `docs/history.md`. **Next: M4 → v0.6.0** (Journal & statistics); nothing is built for it before it is specified and planned.

## Phase

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Current milestone | **M4 → v0.6.0** (Journal & statistics, 09 §M4): not yet specified or planned. v0.5.1 is done: [`v0.5.1`](https://github.com/katznmeik/UmamiT/releases/tag/v0.5.1) from `main` `73a97fc5` |
| Development go from PO | ✅ **In effect** since 2026-10-22 09:05 Europe/Berlin (D-038) |
| Working branch | `claude/wonderful-davinci-fu8tqi` (restarted from `main` `73a97fc5` after the merge of #219) |
| Repository | `katznmeik/UmamiT` (renamed from `UmamiTea` on 2026-10-21; old URLs redirect) |
| Open PR | None (the handover commit on the working branch is docs only and goes into `main` with the next PR) |
| Latest APK | [`v0.5.1`](https://github.com/katznmeik/UmamiT/releases/tag/v0.5.1) (full release, versionCode 50199, from `main` `73a97fc5`, certificate verified); rc `v0.5.1-rc.2` (50102), rc `v0.5.1-rc.1` (50101); [`v0.5.0`](https://github.com/katznmeik/UmamiT/releases/tag/v0.5.0) (50099) |
| Decision numbers | Up to **D-111** used; the next free is **D-112** |

## Working agreements in effect

- **Tiers (D-101):** T1 Sonnet `low`, T2 Sonnet `medium`, T3 Opus `medium`, T4 Opus `high`. `xhigh` only with the PO's OK; never `max`. Timer, backup and migration code is never below T3.
- **Sessions (D-101):** one phase per session. Each phase ends with a handover in this file (and a resume note if the phase stops part-way) that names the model the next phase needs.
- **Next-session prompt (PO, 2026-11-10):** whenever a new session is to be started, the current session's last message ends with the ready-to-paste prompt for it (CLAUDE.md „Start of every session", 12 §5.1).
- **Briefs and reviews (D-101):** lean implementer briefs (12 §5.2); one milestone review at T3, plus T4 for a changed timer path; `/review-animations` once per milestone.
- **Parallelism:** at most **2** implementer subagents at a time, and **one Gradle build at a time** (the machine-wide lock in `v0.4.0-resume.md` §3).
- **Reporting:** push notifications only when the PO must act (rc ready, a blocking question). Questions go to the PO as selectable options.
- **Merging:** Claude merges all PRs (D-037); the PO only approves milestone PRs.
- **CI (D-105):** a change of `docs/**`, `*.md` or `.claude/**` only skips the checks, build and emulator jobs and still counts as a successful run for the release check; anything else, or any doubt, runs the full gate.

## Waiting on the PO

1. **M4 → v0.6.0:** nothing blocking; the next step is specifying M4 (e.g. `/to-spec`) when the PO wants to start.
2. **Optional, at any time:** the PO's own alarm or Vorwarnung recordings (`docs/design/assets/source/sound-alert-<name>.wav`, `sound-prealert-<name>.wav`; WAV, sound from the first sample). Each becomes one more entry in `PreAlertSound` / `AlertSound`.
3. **Optional:** install the Claude GitHub App on the repository (https://github.com/apps/claude/installations/select_target). Without it, PR CI results don't wake a session; the sessions check CI themselves.
4. **Environment:** cloud sessions must run in the personal environment **„UmamiT"** (created 2026-11-08: `dl.google.com`, Gradle and Maven hosts, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `www.tee-kontor-kiel.de`). The plain „Default" environment blocks `dl.google.com`, so the Android plugin doesn't resolve.

## Open for later

- **M4 → v0.6.0** (Journal & statistics, 09 §M4; was v0.5.0 until D-108). Known starting points: A6 (Journal) and A9 (Statistik) empty states; v0.4.1's setup and session page show no tea photo yet (02 TEA-05).
- **Parked from v0.3.0:** the two *Pause* buttons and the shortened tea name in the brew row at font 2.0.
- **#58:** its remaining optional review findings stay open for later milestones.
- **Images:** all delivered. A6 (Journal) and A9 (Statistik) empty states are built in with M4.

## Known caveats

- Mockup images still show the old name „UmamiTea".
- Live Update / ProgressStyle and the full-screen alert were verified on the Galaxy with `v0.0.2-probe`; the full timer keeps those patterns (D-043, D-044, `docs/plans/M1-android16-api-notes.md`). Now Bar presence is best effort.
- Tee-Kontor uses Cloudflare; refreshes may get blocked (handled by stopping without changes).
- After a reboot, alerts fire only once the phone has been unlocked (E2); Samsung's automatic overnight restart should be disabled (ONB-02).
- Robolectric fetches its runtime jar at test time; a network hiccup has failed CI before. Rerun once and comment on the PR.
